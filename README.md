# ChargeZoneApr2023
In partnership with [ExperiencesWithEVs](https://expwithevs.substack.com/), I derived additional insight into Charge Zone's charging utilization trends for April 2023 by extracting and analyzing consumption data from [this heatmap image](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7065230575158108161/) they posted on LinkedIn.

This was my first time using computer vision to extract information, and my first major Python-based project. Insights from this exercise will be published in a blog post soon, so stay tuned!
