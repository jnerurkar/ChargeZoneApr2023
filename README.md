# ChargeZoneApr2023
As one of the largest electric vehicle (EV) charging station networks in India, ChargeZone’s consumption patterns provide valuable insight into the rapid expansion of the EV industry in India, and the resulting modernization of the economy as a whole.

In partnership with [ExperiencesWithEVs](https://expwithevs.substack.com/), I derived additional insight into ChargeZone's charging utilization trends for April 2023 by extracting and analyzing consumption data from [this heatmap image](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7065230575158108161/) they posted on LinkedIn. The resulting [article](https://expwithevs.substack.com/p/chargezone-insights-for-april-2023) contains insights from my analysis, as well as commentary from experts in the Indian EV industry.

This was my first time using computer vision to extract information, and my first major Python-based project. Packages used include numpy for calculations, pandas for infrastructure, openCV (cv2) for computer vision and matplotlib for visualization. Limitations include the assumptions made throughout the project, and the lack of detail surrounding the extacted data.
